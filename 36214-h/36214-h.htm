<p class="blockquot"><i>A multitude of citizens gathered therein. Disturbance shown among
them by sullen looks and murmurings. Four citizens, two in patrician
and two in plebeian garments, confer together.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<i>1st Cit.</i> Enough, enough! I see we all agree<br />
Upon this common cause of our grievance;<br />
Our ranks, our unmixed blood, our differences,<br />
Are all forgotten&mdash;nay, methinks they shall<br />
In time together mingle when our blood<br />
Shall be poured forth in this most righteous cause.<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Cit.</i> As ever art thou eloquent, O Marius,<br />
And just; Brutus himself were not more so.<br />
Patrician and plebeian, equalized<br />
By common woe, together whisper menace<br />
To those who work such havoc as, indeed,<br />
Was never known in Rome until to-day.<br />
<br />
<i>3rd Cit.</i> Ye two are nobles; we, the commons are;<br />
Yet all are leveled by the grief we feel<br />
For Rome, our mother city, who so low<br />
Hath fall'n. Hark! the multitude itself<br />
Is wroth as we, yet, e'en as we, it lacks<br />
The courage needful for this fierce occasion.<br />
<br />
<i>4th Cit.</i> Ay, list indeed! Mark how the murmur swells!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>They turn, and follow with their eyes the gaze of the Roman mob.</i></p>

<p><i>Voices of lictors</i> (<i>without</i>). Make way, ye Romans, way for the noble Ten!<br />
<br />
<i>3rd Cit.</i> Pah! they announce them like to royal kings!<br />
<br />
<i>1st Cit.</i> Tyrants are ceremonious to the letter.<br />
<br />
<i>Multitude.</i> All hail to the lawgivers! Life and peace<br />
Unto the Ten!<br />
<br />
<i>2nd Cit.</i> Jove's lightning strike them down,<br />
The turncoats! Ah, the cowards and the curs!<br />
Perfidious gang of fawners! Do they thus<br />
Forget their wrongs in the wrongdoer's presence,<br />
Or veil them with that slime, false loyalty?</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Enter the Ten Decemvirs, each preceded by twelve lictors armed
with fasces.</i></p>

<p><i>4th Cit.</i> Lo! the presumption! How each lictor bears<br />
Amongst his rods an axe to indicate<br />
That life and death lie in his master's word.<br />
Once was each tyrant pleased with one attendant<br />
The way to clear&mdash;now must they number twelve.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>The Decemvirs pause a space, the while their leader, Appius
Claudius, addresses the assembled citizens.</i></p>

<p><i>Appius.</i> Ye Roman citizens! Unto our ears<br />
Murmurings hath arrived laden with strife;<br />
And though this day ye have protested loud<br />
Your loyalty, and hailed us with acclaim,<br />
Ye seem but ill-content. This must not be.<br />
We have been lenient to every class&mdash;<br />
What ye demand in reason ye receive.<br />
Ye called for written laws, and lo! they hang<br />
Within the Forum that all eyes may read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span><br />
Yet, mark ye! Read not only, but obey,<br />
Else blood shall pour in torrents on these stones.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Low, angry murmur.</i></p>

<p>What! would ye show your teeth, ye nobles brave,<br />
Would bare your fangs, O ye plebeian dogs!<br />
Your teeth are drawn, patricians, and your fangs<br />
Are dull, indeed, ye curs!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>A hissing protest.</i></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 11em;">What, open schism?</span><br />
Ho, lictors, strike! Ah! would ye calmer grow?<br />
Lictors, enough! Now must we on. Our time<br />
Is pressing.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>As he is on the point of departing with his colleagues, his gaze
is arrested by the passing of a girl, clad all in white, attended by
her nurse, through the Forum.</i></p>

<p>(<i>To a companion.</i>) Now, by the ghost of Ixion, behold<br />
Yon perfect vision of most perfect beauty.<br />
Enchanting grace! Exquisite featuring!<br />
Youth lightly shadowed by young womanhood!<br />
My passions, Oppius, are all awake.<br />
Aflame and spreading fast! Why, I would burn<br />
All Rome to own her, touch her, feel her near;<br />
I would receive the curses of the gods,<br />
Be hurled to lowest Hades, and endure<br />
The tortures set for Tantalus himself<br />
If I might call her mine. Her kiss would prove<br />
Sufficient food for me, her liquid eyes<br />
Would quench my thirst if I should look within<br />
And see the tears or draw the starry light<br />
Into my soul! O, Appius, ye are stricken!<br />
<br />
<i>Oppius.</i> Peace, peace, mine Appius, the maid is gone&mdash;<br />
Thy looks are wild, thy features are convulsed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
With passion.<br />
<br />
<i>1st Cit.</i> See, Hortensius, yon man?<br />
What ails him? Like a madman is his gaze,<br />
And horrid is his flaming countenance.<br />
<br />
<i>Oppius.</i> Come, brother, come, my colleague, let's away.<br />
<br />
<i>Appius.</i> Hands off, O, foolish man, for I am dead<br />
To protest. I have been by lightning stricken.<br />
<br />
<i>Oppius.</i>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">It is, indeed, too passionate to be</span><br />
The wound from Eros' feathered shaft.<br />
<br />
<i>Appius</i> (<i>groaning</i>).    <span style="margin-left: 5em;"> Ah! God!</span><br />
Where has she gone? I can not see her face<br />
Nor matchless form within the dreary crowd,<br />
Women I spy in plenty. What a mob<br />
Of uncouth shapes and homely featuring<br />
These females are! She was a Cynthia,<br />
And all beside her, hideous and bold<br />
Bacchantes. I'll a lictor straight despatch,<br />
To seize on her, for she belongs to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Oppius.</i> Nay, fool! Rash fool! Thou art not Jupiter<br />
In power, that thou darest thus to seize,<br />
In open daylight, objects of thy lust,<br />
When they are daughters of free citizens.<br />
Some shadow of excuse must herald such<br />
Bold actions, lest the rabble rise in arms,<br />
As in the days of fair Lucretia!<br />
Thou canst presume, and yet in thy presumption<br />
Play the sly part of virtue, ay, and justice,<br />
Nor seem a mad and bigoted abductor.<br />
I know the maid; a blameless child of one<br />
Virginius, a soldier and a pleb.<br />
Wait, wait, and on the morrow form thy plans,<br />
But for this moment let the matter rest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><br />
If thou art prudent. Come, let's on; the mob<br />
Follows thy gaze, noting thy steadfast look.<br />
<br />
<i>Appius.</i> Speed morrow then. For I am now no better<br />
Than madman; I, who hold the whole of Rome<br />
Under my thumb, am raving only for<br />
Nor heaven nor earth, nor power, nay, nor fame,<br />
But for the captivation of a maid&mdash;<br />
But for Virginia. Onward, let us on!<br />
I'll march into the grim, gray gates of eve<br />
And meet the morrow ere it hath arisen,<br />
Tear down the portals of the night and force<br />
My way into the chamber where the morn<br />
Dozes, a lovely slothful soul of hope,<br />
And seizing on her, madly I'll demand<br />
Virginia!     <span style="margin-left: 7em;"> [<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene II&mdash;A Street in Rome.</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter Marius and Horatius, two patricians.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<i>Marius.</i> He dared! he dared! he dared!<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius.</i>       <span style="margin-left: 9em;"> And will dare more,</span><br />
Until Rome wakens from her lethargy<br />
And is herself again.<br />
<br />
<i>Marius.</i>       <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Till then we wait,</span><br />
Enduring insult, tyranny, from him,<br />
The common enemy of nobleman<br />
And pleb.<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius.</i> Alas! once was he common friend<br />
To both&mdash;our lawgiver; what changed him so?<br />
<br />
<i>Marius.</i> A worm of pride that gnawed into his heart,<br />
A blast of fiery desert wind that dried,<br />
Withered and seared his noble disposition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />
To-day he is a monster, where he was<br />
But yesterday a leader and a god.<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius.</i> He angered the patricians by his show<br />
Of democratic policy; the plebs<br />
By barring intermarriage 'twixt the two<br />
Opposing classes!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Enter Virginius and Icilius.</i></p>

<p><i>Virginius.</i> Blessings, health to you!<br />
Good wishes of a Roman unto Romans.<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). Say rather, helpless, sullen, brooding curs!<br />
We are no more&mdash;methinks <i>thou</i> art no more;<br />
Nor even thou, Icilius, our tribune.<br />
There are no free, courageous sons of Rome,<br />
But victims only, cowed beneath the lash<br />
Of the Decemvirs&mdash;curses on their heads!<br />
<br />
<i>Virginius.</i> Methinks I'm not the dog that thou hast said,<br />
For 'tis my part and wish to play the man.<br />
The name of Appius I do despise,<br />
And only bide my time to bury it<br />
Deep in the soil, along with him who bears<br />
Its weight. Although I will not fling myself<br />
Upon the altar of Unreason as<br />
A bootless sacrifice, yet am I still<br />
Nor dog, nor worm, but one who waits and prays,<br />
Nor prays alone, but puzzles out his plan<br />
Of action. No, nor plans alone, but strives;<br />
And striving, must achieve, unless the hand<br />
Of sudden Death come in to tear the web.<br />
Friends, we are hard pressed and we pant in pain,<br />
Yet tyrants, howsoever strong, are still<br />
Weaker than Justice and are shorter-lived<br />
Than Liberty, the queen whom Justice serves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><br />
Because our wrongs are heavy must we brood,<br />
And chafe, and curse our stars and Appius?<br />
What war was ever closed successfully<br />
With sullen warriors and men untrained,<br />
Unready or undone by foul Despair?<br />
<br />
<i>Icilius.</i> Thou hast inspired me and curbed my wrath,<br />
Which held in it no reason, all unbound,<br />
Ready to leap a lion on its prey.<br />
Ay, there's a time for all things. I shall wait,<br />
Knowing, Virginius, that thy words are true.<br />
Wisdom, the gods be thanked, hath never flowed<br />
Forth from thy lips in words of honeyed sounds,<br />
Nor yet in pompous phrases burdened down<br />
With ponderous eloquence, but bold and frank,<br />
Shining as bright and ringing forth as true<br />
As thy good sword that thou hast borne so well<br />
In camp, palestra, or in battle-field.<br />
<br />
<i>Virginius.</i> My words are bold, for I am full of grief<br />
At men's delinquency and heavy souls;<br />
Frank&mdash;ay; because 'tis late to talk in riddles<br />
Or metaphors, that veil the precious truth<br />
Within; shining with fervor, ringing true,<br />
Because the cause I do uphold is true<br />
As life and death is real.<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius.</i>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Thine eloquence</span><br />
Is worthy of a better hearing than<br />
This little company. I would that thou<br />
Wouldst lead us into action, noble pleb.<br />
<br />
<i>Virginius.</i> My duties are at present with mine own&mdash;<br />
With her, my fair ewe-lamb; when she becomes<br />
The spouse of this our friend and our tribune,<br />
Virginius shall owe himself to none,<br />
But feel compelled the Commonwealth alone<br />
To serve. And here's my hand in oath that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
Shall serve it well! The gods help Appius!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Enter Sicinius, in civilian garments.</i></p>

<p><i>Marius.</i> Greetings, Sicinius, and health to thee!<br />
<br />
<i>Sic.</i> And Heaven's favor unto you, my friends.<br />
How now! All deep in sombre conference?<br />
<br />
<i>Icilius</i> (<i>impetuously</i>). Sicinius! What curse hath come to Rome,<br />
That bends her proud and regal head beneath<br />
The yoke of shame? The collar of the serf<br />
Hangs heavy round her haughty neck. Ye gods!<br />
The mightly Romulus, methinks, must find<br />
The grave a cell that keeps him from his Rome;<br />
How must his mighty spirit chafe when he<br />
Receiveth tidings from the newly dead,<br />
Concerning this, his city, now so low<br />
Amid the dust of Wrong and Bigotry!<br />
Tell us, thou man of action, what bold move<br />
We needs must make. Oh! be our &OElig;dipus!<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius.</i> Hist, noble tribune! Favor silence. These<br />
Are times of peril; cast thou Caution's die.<br />
<br />
<i>Icilius</i> (<i>amazed</i>). What! knowest thou not this man, Sicinius?<br />
He who has bearded all the noble Ten,<br />
He whose brave words of indignation ring<br />
From hill to hill of Rome? Sicinius!<br />
<br />
<i>Horatius</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). I have been absent from the town these twelve<br />
Long moons, nor know I all that thou dost know.<br />
<br />
<i>Icilius.</i> Why, man, look not so sour and so sad.<br />

<i>Virginius.</i> Peace, youths! Sicinius hath but little chance<br />
To speak his mind. I beg of thee that thou,<br />
Good friend, expound thy views as to these days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br />
Of tyranny, for Romans are at bay.<br />
<br />
<i>Sic.</i> If I should speak, then would I speak myself<br />
Into my grave; so twist mine earnest tongue<br />
As soon would wring it from its fevered roots,<br />
Mine eyeballs blind themselves with fiery tears<br />
Of love for Rome; my life would withered be<br />
With all the curses breathing forth, aflame<br />
With hate for Appius! Oh, ye gods! in what<br />
Have we outraged you that we now are cursed<br />
With such a blight as Famine never cast<br />
Over the fields of plenty, withering<br />
Alike the grain and the wild wayside bloom,<br />
Sweeping across the vast, bright lands of peace,<br />
And leaving staring Ruin in its way?<br />
Oh! Rome, thou much-wronged child of Romulus,<br />
That I might break the seals from off thine eyes,<br />
And place a flaming sword within thy hand,<br />
A watchword in thine ear&mdash;"Endure for her<br />
Who is thy rightful mistress, Liberty."<br />
A battle-cry upon thy glowing lips,<br />
"Onward!" A prayer within thy mighty heart,<br />
And prophecy to stir thy godlike soul<br />
To action. But the times are ripening!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>A pause.</i><br />
Could I relate thy wrongs, I would not cease,<br />
Nor spare myself, but speaking, sink to earth,<br />
Worn with the task. Yet who can number them<br />
That are as numberless as Heaven's stars?<br />
I say, as I have said to you before,<br />
We Romans will again secede, again<br />
March, in a body, to the Sacred Mount,<br />
And threaten as of old another Rome,<br />
A nobler Rome, a Rome unbound and free,<br />
To found thereon, or else a revolution,<br />
Bloody and merciless and full of horrors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
Shall ravage Rome, but we be satisfied.<br />
The fire and the sword hath ready tongues;<br />
They fawn not to the great, nor spare the high,<br />
They lick and bite nor fail in eloquence.<br />
So, to the fire and the sword must we<br />
Resort; for city, home, and cherished ones<br />
Demand that guilty blood, as a libation,<br />
Be poured in answer to the blood of Rome,<br />
Which crieth to her children from the ground!<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>The curtain, rising, discovers a bondmaid in the center of a
spacious court, filling her pitcher at the fountain. It is midday,
and the light streams down from above, flooding the entire space
with radiance. The woman sings in an undertone, as she turns to
water the roses twined around the columns in the background. Enter
Marcus Claudius. He approaches the maiden, leisurely.</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Marc.</i> Ah! pretty one! Fortune has favored me!<br />
I enter in due time to proffer aid.<br />
<br />
<i>Slave.</i> Nay, shame on thee, a man free-born, to thus<br />
Address a bondmaid, when there is no need.<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> Thy humble mien is fitting, girl, but I<br />
Am modest, and, thus far, will graciously<br />
Demean myself.<br />
<br />
<i>Slave.</i>      <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Demean thyself, indeed!</span><br />
I only mocked thee, fool; thy proffered aid<br />
I scorn. Low-born plebeian, who art thou,<br />
To set thyself above a child of kings?<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> (<i>angrily</i>). Ha! Have a care! Take heed! Thy saucy tongue<br />
Eludes thee, mischief hungry. Fairest slave,<br />
But for that very fairness which is thine,<br />
I'd have thee lashed by him who favors me!<br />
<br />
<i>Slave</i> (<i>wheeling about in scorn</i>). Who shelters, who supports, who uses thee,<br />
And for his own vile ends! Lends thee his brains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><br />
His power and knowledge for thy petty, sly<br />
Returns. He, fierce and false; thou, mean and small;<br />
He, merciless; thou, only Marcus' friend&mdash;And<br />
both unscrupulous as Mercury.<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> (<i>furiously</i>). Thou art too scathing in thy judgment, damsel!<br />
<br />
<i>Slave.</i> Nay, I am mild to what thou dost deserve.<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> How darest thou, a slave, to judge me so?<br />
<br />
<i>Slave.</i> King Tarquin, called Superbus, or the Proud,<br />
He was mine ancestor. And I, alone<br />
Left of his line, in bondage languish. <i>Thou</i>,&mdash;<br />
What canst thou boast of? Of the blood of plebs,<br />
Yet lower e'en than they who gave thee birth;<br />
Despised of all, for thou art neither slave,<br />
Nor free; thou hangest slothlike on the skirts<br />
Of mighty men, that they may represent<br />
Thy cause&mdash;support, succor, and plead for thee,<br />
In gratitude for thy poor services.<br />
Avaunt! Fawner and client, touch me not!</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>She spurns him when he would approach her, and haughtily departs.</i> </p>

<p><i>Marc.</i> (<i>gazing after her</i>). Adieu, thou helpless scorner, chained despiser,<br />
Thy tongue hath sought to whip me sore&mdash;in vain.<br />
A client knows not shame nor injured pride.<br />
Nor is he haughty, for the blood of kings<br />
Heats not his veins. So Marcus, too, is low,<br />
Ready to stoop to aught, however base,<br />
To gain his ends. But triumph over triumphs!<br />
Marcus will issue forth the conqueror.<br />
Flushed with his victory, while other men<br />
Lie low and bite the dust because they clung<br />
To honor! He, clean void of conscience, sucks<br />
The sweets of life down to their sweetest dregs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       [<i>Pauses.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br />

Leaving me reeling, drunk with loveliness.<br />
I have imbibed deeply this day in wine,<br />
Yet hath it less intoxicating power<br />
Than hath a tremor of her lashes or<br />
A flutter of her garments! I am struck,<br />
And heavily!        <span style="margin-left: 7em;">   [<i>He groans and clasps his head with his hands.</i></span><br />

Better to me this pleasure than the sight<br />
Of fair Elysium. Such ecstasy<br />
As is the privilege and portion of<br />
Souls freed from Hades and its rack and wheel<br />
And snatched to Heaven, can no sweeter be<br />
Than is mine ecstasy, when wafted on<br />
The summer zephyr, comes this breath, divine,<br />
Of nectar and ambrosia in one.<br />
Virginia, to myself, to thee, to Love,<br />
I drink! And now, my Marcus, sit thee down!<br />
I would confer with thee.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Marc.</i> (<i>seats himself</i>). What is thy will?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Appius.</i> Marcus, this morn I made my way in state<br />
Through Rome&mdash;and, in the market-place, beheld<br />
A sight that hath undone me for this day.<br />
My heart hath slipped its leash and now is set<br />
Hard on the trail, not to be turned aside.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Marc.</i> What vision hath the gods vouchsafed thee, then?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Appius.</i>'Twas more than vision, thanks to Vulcan be,<br />
Who did create that mortal styled a woman,<br />
At once a snare, at once a perfect boon;<br />
At once a curse, at once a lasting blessing.<br />
It was a maid, a lowly, mortal maid,<br />
A maid of mean plebeian birth as well,<br />
Yet beautiful as though she had arisen<br />
From out the golden heart of some fair rose,<br />
Or drowsy, dreamy, tempting, fresh and fair,<br />
Had issued, shyly, from the troubled depths<br />
Of rock-bound spring, a nymph but newly born,<br />
And shrinking from the glances of the morn.<br />
Virginia, child of one Virginius,<br />
Centurion of courage and renown,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><br />
She burst upon me like a revelation<br />
Unto a prophet. She is mine as sure<br />
As are the stars possessions of the Night.<br />
She'll have no will but mine, no choice but mine;<br />
She'll yield her body unto me, until<br />
I find the chance to win her heart and soul.<br />
I'll hold her and I'll kiss her heart away;<br />
I'll chain her soul to mine with links of gold.<br />
But whether she shall ever love me true<br />
I little care, so that her lips are mine.<br />
So that I daily touch her hands and feel<br />
Her dusky hair blow cloudlike 'gainst my cheek.<br />
Marcus, thou art the man to work my weal,<br />
By aiding me in this, mine enterprise.<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> What! Shall I play the game and thou receive<br />
The winnings?<br />
<br />
<i>Appius</i> (<i>haughtily</i>). Ay, assuredly. O, pause,<br />
And pausing, see thyself in honest light.<br />
Thou art my client; thou to <i>me</i> dost owe<br />
Thy safety, standing, possibly thy life.<br />
I know the law&mdash;I <i>made</i>, the law, the while<br />
Thou canst not read a letter; as a pleb<br />
Few rights are thine&mdash;those few I gave thy class<br />
At the expense of the patrician favor.<br />
Break with me, and thou'lt break thy fortunes, ope<br />
Thy chest of troubles, like the silly maid<br />
Who brought untold misfortunes on herself<br />
And on the world. Assist me and thou'lt gain<br />
My favor, keep my needful, strong protection.<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i> Enough! I follow thee and will obey.<br />
<br />
<i>Appius.</i> E'en to the letter?<br />
<br />
<i>Marc.</i>    <span style="margin-left: 4em;">To the letter, lord.</span><br />
<br />
<i>Appius.</i> Then hearken. Choose some morning, soon or late,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
And hasten to the market-place. The maid<br />
Receiveth schooling there. When she appears,<br />
Spring forward boldly, seize her by the arm,<br />
(And yet be not too rude in thy demeanor);<br />
When all the multitude around demand<br />
An explanation, say to them that she<br />
Was born of a slave-woman in thy house,<br />
Ere thou a client had become. And add<br />
That she had been in secret borne away,<br />
And, by the wife of one Virginius,<br />
Claimed as a child; her own at birth had died,<br />
And he, Virginius, kept in ignorance,<br />
Grossly deceived, believeth it his flesh<br />
And blood. The tale is wild; no proof hast thou,<br />
Nor witnesses; and yet it is enough<br />
Seeing that I control the Romans as<br />
The Fates control the lives of mortal men,<br />
And need the barest shadow of excuse<br />
To work my will&mdash;I, who am autocrat!<br />
Assume a righteous air, if that doth lie<br />
Within the limits of thy doubtful, rare<br />
Accomplishments. When they protest, then say<br />
"To Appius for justice I will go,"<br />
And leave the rest to me.<br />
<br />
<i>Marcus.</i>      <span style="margin-left: 6em;"> Ay, leave to thee</span><br />
The cowing of the Roman mob, for that<br />
Lieth within the limits of <i>thy</i> rare,<br />
Doubtful accomplishments. So let it be.<br />
I'll serve thee well&mdash;will my returns be worthy<br />
The peril of my venture?<br />
<br />
<i>Appius.</i>      <span style="margin-left: 7em;"> Also leave</span><br />
That matter unto me.</p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>Style of ornaments and hangings very simple. Virginia, bending over

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Virg.</i> Nay, now, let be! 'Tis most becoming so.<br />
What! would'st thou call't presumptious to assume<br />
The style of headdress worn by noble ladies?<br />
Foolish Camilla! Thou art nobler far<br />
Than many score fine dames, however high<br />
They hold their heads or wear their tresses&mdash;so!<br />
Oh, 'tis entrancing! Stay, I have not done.<br />

<br />

Thy kind old cheek so oft and have imbibed<br />
Therefrom the sweetness only found in thee.<br />
And I am silly&mdash;I suppose, because<br />
The gods have made me so. Now, turn about<br />
Thy head. How white thy hair of late hath grown!<br />

<i>Camilla.</i> Sweet one, because thou art so gay to-day,<br />
I fear to-morrow thou wilt be in tears.<br />
Excess of spirits bears excess of grief.<br />
Thou'rt young and fair as Hero; but to her<br />
Misfortune came and loss and heavy woe!<br />
<br />
<i>Virg.</i> Now, thou remindest me of Wisdom's owl&mdash;<br />
Croak not so somberly. Thou who art one<br />
Whose heart is ever genial with mirth,<br />
Wrong'st Nature to cast shadows over youth.<br />
<br />
<i>Camilla</i> (<i>drawing Virginia to her tenderly</i>). My little love, I would not seem to sigh;<br />
Ever have I despised a sorry face,<br />
A gloomy or foreboding disposition.<br />
Thou hast most aptly said that I to-day<br />
Belie my character. Forgive! Forget!<br />
<br />
<i>Virg.</i> (<i>pouting</i>). Forget, thou croaking raven of despair?<br />
Thou dost expect too much. I may forgive,<br />
But not forget. What ailest thee to-day?<br />
Art thou not ill or weary with thy tasks?<br />
We'll make thy labor lighter, and thy cares<br />
As to the household now shall rest on me.<br />

I am not ill nor weary, nay, nor sad,<br />
But fearful and in dread of hidden woe.<br />
What may the morrow bring to thee, my babe,<br />
Or to thy father, or thy lover? What,<br />
I can not see, but only feel and dread.<br />
<br />
<i>Virg.</i> Camilla! Something surely ails thee now.<br />

By thy prophetic words, thy drear address,<br />
And I would probe thy meaning deeply, lest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span><br />

That I might put to thee or e'en myself<br />
In syllables, I'd speak. But syllables<br />

Dull, helpless weapons, powerless unless<br />
The thoughts are present skillfully to wield<br />
The blades. Then cut and thrust they mightily,<br />
Ready to wound, or e'en with menace kill.<br />

Were full of peace and thee. And in the light<br />
Shed by the homing sun&mdash;the purple, red,<br />
And gold&mdash;I dreamed fair dreams, imagined visions.<br />
Methought I saw the coming years of bliss,<br />
Deepened with sorrow, lined with simple care;<br />
The sorrow of a mortal, and the care<br />
Of wife and mother. Then, at once, arose<br />
Longings that I might always worthy be,<br />
As was Eurydice of Orpheus.<br />
Never to falter, howsoe'er I feared,<br />
Turn not, stay not, fail not; a woman in<br />
My services and steadfast faith, as well<br />

I thought of how it grew, so shy, so slow,<br />

A white Diana of nocturnal glades,<br />

I've seen thee flame into an Aphrodite,<br />

My love, my full and perfected ideal,<br />
My Helen and my delicate &AElig;none.<br />
My nymph and my incomparable queen<br />
In one. Come closer to my arms, beloved!<br />
I would not lose in any sense or thought<br />

Deeper and deeper, stronger and more strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><br />
Each in the other till we are not two,<br />

<i>Icilius.</i> As close as vein to leaf, or leaf to stem;<br />
As close as is the rose-flush in the heart<br />
Of ocean's shell unto the shell itself;<br />
Close as the star is to its atmosphere;<br />
Wedded as day and night, no break, no void<br />
Between, but only faintest change and lights,<br />
Born of a higher world, a purer sphere,<br />
Heaven-conceived, begotten of the sky.</p>

<i>Virg.</i> Nay, I could never weary in thy sight.<br />
Have I not called thy kisses and embrace<br />
My wine, my flame, my moonlight and my stars?<br />
I am not weary. But I'll come within&mdash;<br />
The morrow brings a fresh Elysium.<br />

<p class="blockquot"><i>Apartment spacious and luxurious, with hangings of various kinds.
Cornelia, who is reclining in an arm chair, occupies the center of
the room; a female stands behind her in the act of arranging her
hair. On the left is a boy in rich patrician dress, seated beside an
oblong bath, engaged in sailing a tiny fleet of vessels on the
surface of the water. On the right are a number of attendants,
conversing in undertones.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Cor.</i> Ah, gods! I am most sad and most aweary<br />
Of this routine of state, unrestful splendor.<br />
My lovers love not me but my possessions,<br />
My friends are envious of my delights.<br />
Wretched aristocrats! Unhappy we<br />
Who call ourselves patricians, and who swear<br />
Our race is blessed of the most blessed gods!<br />
Say rather cursed, and with a heavy curse!<br />
How can I give my heart to those who are<br />
By <i>noble</i> blood worthy and eligible,<br />
After the Roman laws, to sue for it?<br />
Eros with them is but an empty name;<br />
Passion and lust and horrible ambition<br />
Form the emotions of these "blessed" ones.<br />
And I, unhappy, love with pure desire<br />
Sicinius, a soldier and a pleb!<br />
Yet hath the Ten forbidden intermarriage,<br />
Just when those bars of difference were about<br />
To fall away and Heaven ope for me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>To the attendant.</i></p>

Thou foolish maid.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia.</i> Believe me, thou in thy<br />

Adonis, as would keep him from the chase<br />
Where Venus pled in vain.<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> Tut, flatterer!<br />
<br />
<i>Julia</i> (<i>slyly</i>). Methinks I'd make a model lover then<br />
If I do flatter. Is't not so, sweet lady?<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> (<i>bitterly</i>). Lovers are mockeries in this blackened age.<br />
A maid may wed the low-souled fool so long<br />
As he's high-born! The man of noble mind<br />
Is numbered, if a common, 'mongst the dead.<br />
<br />
<i>Julia</i> (<i>idly</i>). Methinks Sicinius comes here anon?<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> (<i>in displeasure</i>). What! Insolent! Who bade thee speak, I pray?<br />
<br />
<i>Julia</i> (<i>softly</i>). Lady, mine eyes are clear and quick to see,<br />
And thy heart's sentinels are slumbering.<br />
I mean no insolence, by all the gods!<br />
My motive only love and sympathy.<br />
I, too, am a plebeian, and rejoice<br />
To see thy gracious, noble condescension.<br />
Yet in my joy I well could weep with pain,<br />
Seeing the darkness of thy doubtful future.<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> Darkness! It is a void as empty as<br />
My heart this day is full. Begone, I pray,<br />
Each one of you; nay, thou, my Julia, stay<br />
And bid the bards perform a soothing lay.</p>

<i>Cor.</i> Brother, thou art too young to comprehend.<br />
<br />
<i>Tib.</i> Mayhap, for I am only twelve years old;<br />
Yet I'm no dullard, sister, and I weep<br />
Because I see thee sad. Methinks Sicinius<br />
Would weep for thee as well.<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> (<i>starting in dismay</i>). Ye gods of love!<br />
Does all Italia observe my heart,<br />

<br />
<i>Tib.</i> (<i>disdainfully</i>). No, never; gossip reacheth not mine ears.<br />
But oft I hear thee sigh and then, within<br />
The selfsame breath, breathe forth a name I know;<br />
A name all Romans know&mdash;Sicinius.<br />
Ay, and I oft have heard thee sob, although<br />
I fain had heard it not, since thou desirest<br />
Thy grief held secret. Sister mine, how canst<br />
Thou hope to wed a soldier and a pleb?<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> Alas! Alas! Mine own Tiberius!<br />
No hope have I, and yet I love my strength<br />
Away&mdash;my heart and soul are all aflame<br />
With a wild conflagration. Boy, thou seemest<br />
Inclined to comprehend my fierce emotions,<br />
Bitter despair and strange besieging hope,<br />
That scarce is conscious hope, but mocked and crushed<br />
By the stern laws of Rome and tyranny<br />
Of the false Ten, since ever it was born.<br />
Thy bright brown eyes are luminous with soul;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><br />
Wise, gentle brother, dost thou weep for me?<br />

Cornelia, would that I might succor thee!<br />
<br />
<i>Cor.</i> Most dear, my brother, weep no more for me;<br />
The gods, who love true lovers, do despise<br />
Tyrants and murderers, and sure will aid<br />

Time is a greybeard, and he will not haste<br />
At any whim, and Fate, a bigot stern,<br />

Perchance thou hast survived these perils, so<br />
Thou mayst give comfort to thy troubled sister.<br />

Surely his voice dismissing his attendant&mdash;<br />
And now a knocking on the outer door!<br />
The porter cometh nigh. Tiberius,<br />
'Tis he! I dreamed not he could come this day!<br />
<br />
<i>Tib.</i> Then I'll begone, sister; give me a kiss;<br />
I'll seek thee later and relate my voyage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exit.</i><br />

The simple nature of his simple class,<br />

<br />

The life of Appius will soon be spanned,<br />

Glad, with the day. And now&mdash;Cornelia, touch<br />

Feel if my heart yet beats. Methinks I'm dead;<br />
Even this moment but a roving ghost.<br />

How often I have watched him in the grass,<br />
Familiar, small, erect, and bravely dressed<br />

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
